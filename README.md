# LCC Robotics 2023 Repository

This repo contains the code for LCC's robot for AVIA 2023, a robotics competition hosted by CRC Robotics. 

It is scaffolded using the `PlatformIO` framework with `megaatmega2560` as its target. We have decided to use `PlatformIO` because it allows for flexible and platform-agnostic projections with minimal configuration. 

## Cloning the Repo

## Build and Upload

To build and upload this project, we recommend using the `VSCode` extension for `PlatformIO`, as it is tried and true by the team. However, it is also possible to build and upload using the `PlatformIO` [CLI tool](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/core/index.html) or one of the other official IDE [extensions](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/index.html).
