## Commit Message Guidelines
Inspired by: https://gist.github.com/abravalheri/34aeb7b18d61392251a2

### Commit Message Format

    <type>: <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>

#### Allowed \<type\>
The <type> of a commit message should be drawn from this list according to the nature of the commit: 
 - **feat**: A new feature.
 - **fix**: A bug fix.
 - **docs**: Documentation only changes.
 - **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
 - **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
 - **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
 - **test**: Adding missing tests.
 - **build**: Changes to the build/compilation/packaging process or auxiliary tools such as documentation generation.

#### \<subject\> text
Subject line should contain a succinct description of the change.

 - Use imperative, present tense “change”, not “changed” or “changes”.
 - No period at the end.


#### \<body\> text
If the commit is not a minor change, a body text that explains the changes in further detail is encouraged. 

- Like in \<subject\> use imperative, present tense “change”, not “changed” or “changes”.
- Include motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior.
